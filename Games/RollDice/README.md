# ðŸŽ² Roll Dice Game - Java Console Application

A simple Java console-based game that simulates rolling a dice. The player continues to roll the dice by entering `9`, and the score accumulates with each roll **except when a 1 is rolled**, which ends the game.

## Features:

Enter `9` to roll the dice.

If the dice value is between 2 and 6, it is added to your score.

If the dice value is `1`, the game ends and your final score is displayed.

If any input other than `9` is entered, the game will prompt again.
